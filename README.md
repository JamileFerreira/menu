# Menu

Another flutter study project.

This project is basically a food menu with its categories and recipes.
We can see the food categories, favorites, configure foods without some components, such as gluten.

The project is very cool and we can learn a lot from it, such as: navigation between screens, functions, learning the main widgets, knowing how to divide the project and much more.

In the next projects we will include state management.

Anything can get in touch, let's learn together!

Thank you guys!
